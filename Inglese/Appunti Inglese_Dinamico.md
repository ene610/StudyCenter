link agli esercizi www.inglesedinamico.net/libro

## Introduzione
Imparare in modo accademico la lingua non è un buon modo per diventare fluente. Per diventare fluente possiamo provare a apprendere 4 competenze fondamentali quali:
- **Comprensione (scritta/orale)**: Quanto capisci l'inglese. Per migliorare quella scritta bisogna leggere l'inglese da fonti differenti, per quella orale invece devi ascoltare.
- **Lessico**: Devi conoscere tante parole, is divide in lessico generico (ciao, arrivederci) e lessico settoriale di un argomento (eterozigoti, formattare).
- **Velocità mnemonica**: Velocità con cui riesci a ricordarti le parole inglesi. Bisogna fare un sacco di pratica. Si può esercitare anche con lo scritto.
- **Monologo interiore**: Pensare in inglese.
