# Introduction

Azure AI Search enables you to create search solutions in which a pipeline of AI skills is used to enrich data and populate an index. The data enrichments performed by the skills in the pipeline supplement the source data with insights such as:

- The language in which a document is written.
- Key phrases that might help determine the main themes or topics discussed in a document.
- A sentiment score that quantifies how positive or negative a document is.
- Specific locations, people, organizations, or landmarks mentioned in the content.
- AI-generated descriptions of images, or image text extracted by optical character recognition (OCR).

The enriched data in the index makes it possible to create a comprehensive search solution that goes beyond basic full text search of the source content.

## Knowledge stores

While the index might be considered the primary output from an indexing process, the enriched data it contains might also be useful in other ways. For example:

- Since the index is essentially a collection of JSON objects, each representing an indexed record, it might be useful to export the objects as JSON files for integration into a data orchestration process using tools such as Azure Data Factory.
- You may want to normalize the index records into a relational schema of tables for analysis and reporting with tools such as Microsoft Power BI.
- Having extracted embedded images from documents during the indexing process, you might want to save those images as files.

Azure AI Search supports these scenarios by enabling you to define a _knowledge store_ in the skillset that encapsulates your enrichment pipeline. The knowledge store consists of _projections_ of the enriched data, which can be JSON objects, tables, or image files. When an indexer runs the pipeline to create or update an index, the projections are generated and persisted in the knowledge store.

In this module, you'll implement a knowledge store for _Margie's Travel_, a fictitious travel agency that uses information in brochures and hotel reviews to help customers plan trips and you will learn how to:

- Create a knowledge store from an Azure AI Search pipeline
- View data in projections in a knowledge store

Note

This module assumes you already know how to create and use an Azure AI Search solution that includes built-in skills. If not, complete the [Create an Azure AI Search solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/) module first.
# Define projections

The projections of data to be stored in your knowledge store are based on the document structures generated by the enrichment pipeline in your indexing process. Each skill in your skillset iteratively builds a JSON representation of the enriched data for the documents being indexed, and you can persist some or all of the fields in the document as projections.

## Using the _Shaper_ skill

The process of indexing incrementally creates a complex document that contains the various output fields from the skills in the skillset. This can result in a schema that is difficult to work with, and which includes collections of primitive data values that don't map easily to well-formed JSON.

To simplify the mapping of these field values to projections in a knowledge store, it's common to use the **Shaper** skill to create a new, field containing a simpler structure for the fields you want to map to projections.

For example, consider the following Shaper skill definition:

JSON

```
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ShaperSkill",
  "name": "define-projection",
  "description": "Prepare projection fields",
  "context": "/document",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "file_name",
      "source": "/document/metadata_content_name"
    },
    {
      "name": "url",
      "source": "/document/url"
    },
    {
      "name": "sentiment",
      "source": "/document/sentimentScore"
    },
    {
      "name": "key_phrases",
      "source": null,
      "sourceContext": "/document/merged_content/keyphrases/*",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "phrase",
          "source": "/document/merged_content/keyphrases/*"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "output",
      "targetName": "projection"
    }
  ]
}
```

This Shaper skill creates a **projection** field with the following structure:

JSON

```
{
    "file_name": "file_name.pdf",
    "url": "https://<storage_path>/file_name.pdf",
    "sentiment": 1.0,
    "key_phrases": [
        {
            "phrase": "first key phrase"
        },
        {
            "phrase": "second key phrase"
        },
        {
            "phrase": "third key phrase"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The resulting JSON document is well-formed, and easier to map to a projection in a knowledge store than the more complex document that has been built iteratively by the previous skills in the enrichment pipeline.
# Define a knowledge store

To define the knowledge store and the projections you want to create in it, you must create a **knowledgeStore** object in the skillset that specifies the Azure Storage connection string for the storage account where you want to create projections, and the definitions of the projections themselves.

You can define object projections, table projections, and file projections depending on what you want to store; however note that you must define a separate _projection_ for each type of projection, even though each projection contains lists for tables, objects, and files. Projection types are mutually exclusive in a projection definition, so only one of the projection type lists can be populated. If you create all three kinds of projection, you must include a projection for each type; as shown here:

JSON

```
"knowledgeStore": { 
      "storageConnectionString": "<storage_connection_string>", 
      "projections": [
        {
            "objects": [
                {
                "storageContainer": "<container>",
                "source": "/projection"
                }
            ],
            "tables": [],
            "files": []
        },
        {
            "objects": [],
            "tables": [
                {
                "tableName": "KeyPhrases",
                "generatedKeyName": "keyphrase_id",
                "source": "projection/key_phrases/*",
                },
                {
                "tableName": "docs",
                "generatedKeyName": "document_id", 
                "source": "/projection" 
                }
            ],
            "files": []
        },
        {
            "objects": [],
            "tables": [],
            "files": [
                {
                "storageContainer": "<container>",
                "source": "/document/normalized_images/*"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
 }
```

For **object** and **file** projections, the specified container will be created if it does not already exist. An Azure Storage table will be created for each **table** projection, with the mapped fields and a unique key field with the name specified in the **generatedKeyName** property. These key fields can be used to define relational joins between the tables for analysis and reporting.
