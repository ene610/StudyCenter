# Introduction

The Azure OpenAI service enables you to use large language models (LLMs) to generate content based on natural language prompts. One of these models is the DALL-E image generation model, which is capable of creating original graphical content based on natural language descriptions of a desired image.

The ability to use AI to generate graphics has a number of applications; including the creation of illustrations or photorealistic images for articles or marketing collateral, generation of unique product or company logos, or any scenario where a desired image can be described.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the DALL-E model in an instance of the Azure OpenAI service, and retrieve the images it generates.

Note

Use of the Azure OpenAI service is restricted to Azure subscriptions for which access has been requested and approved. If your Azure subscription has previously been granted access to use GPT language generation models in the Azure OpenAI service, you may need to reapply for access to the DALL-E image generation capabilities. For more details about applying for access, see [How do I get access to Azure OpenAI?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai) in the Azure OpenAI service documentation.
# What is DALL-E?

DALL-E is a neural network based model that can generate graphical data from natural language input. Put more simply, you can provide DALL-E with a description and it can generate an appropriate image.

For example, you might submit the following natural language prompt to DALL-E:

_A squirrel on a motorcycle_

This prompt could result in the generation of graphical output such as the following image:

![A picture of a squirrel on a motorcycle.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/wwl-data-ai/generate-images-azure-openai/media/squirrel-on-a-motorcycle.png)

The images generated by DALL-E are original; they are not retrieved from a curated image catalog. In other words, DALL-E is not a search system for _finding_ appropriate images - it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that _generates_ new images based on the data on which it was trained.
# Explore DALL-E in Azure OpenAI Studio

To experiment with DALL-E, you can provision an Azure OpenAI Service resource in an Azure subscription that has been approved for access to the service, and use the _DALL-E playground_ to submit prompts and view the resulting generated images.

When using the playground, you can adjust the **settings** to specify:

- The resolution (size) of the generated images. Available sizes are `256x256`, `512x512`, `1024x1024` (which is the default value), or `1024x1792`.
- The image style to be generated (such as `vivid` or `natural`).
- The image quality (choose from `standard` or `hd`).
# Use the Azure OpenAI REST API to consume DALL-E models

You can use the Azure OpenAI service REST API to consume DALL-E models from applications.

To make a REST call to the service, you need the endpoint and authorization key for the Azure OpenAI Service resource you have provisioned in Azure. You initiate the image generation process by submitting a POST request to the service endpoint with the authorization key in the header. The request must contain the following parameters in a JSON body:

- **prompt**: The description of the image to be generated.
- **n**: The number of images to be generated.
- **size**: The resolution of the image(s) to be generated (_256x256_, _512x512_, or _1024x1024_).

For example, the following JSON could be used to generate an 512 x 512 image of a badger wearing a tuxedo:

JSON

```
{
    "prompt": "A badger wearing a tuxedo",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "512x512"
}
```

The result from the initial request does not immediately return the results of the image generation process. Instead, the response includes an **operation-location** header with a URL for a callback service that your application code can poll until the results of image generation are ready.

When the operation has succeeded, a response similar to the following JSON is returned:

JSON

```
{
    "created": 1686780744,
    "expires": 1686867152,
    "id": "6d765598-eeee-4f49-885d-03ee1c8f9b02",
    "result": {
        "created": 1686780744,
        "data": [
            {
                "url": "https://dalleproduse.....png"
            }
        ]
    },
    "status": "succeeded"
}
```

The **result** element includes a collection of **url** elements, each of which references a PNG image file generated from the prompt. In this example, the file might look similar to the following image:
